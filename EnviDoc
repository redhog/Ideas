Add a file-rewriting system for Arch that can transform files of
certain filetypes (use "file" to determine) prior to check-in and
after check-out.

Example: For OpenDocument files: unzip, add newlines after each
xml-tag in the xml-files

Also make sure merges, conflicts and what-changed --diffs are handled
in some constructive way.

The transformation system can also be used to automagically add
taglines to files that doesn't have them but should according to their
names.

Modify an Arch GUI to work as an Office document version management
system.
